# E-commerceBackEnd

## Description


- This project was created to demonstrate the back end application to help manage a front end e-commerce application.
- This helps companies stay organized with an ever changing product line and stock.
- Having the back end capabilities this project provides will help automate the GUI on the front end helping both the employees and the shoppers.
- This project showed me that separation of concerns can help a developer stay organized as well as the balance between the relationships in the table models and the api routes.

## Usage

This application is completely back end, therefore, requires an environment such as insomnia to view data. Run the server using "node server.js" and use the port shown in the console log in insomnia: http://localhost:PORT
